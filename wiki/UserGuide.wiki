* GettingStarted 

= Login =

If vmaki is set up as described in the Getting Started Guide you can connect to it using your browser (Firefox is highly recommended) entering the url of the host on which vmaki is installed from any workstation in your network. 

You will then be promted to enter the username and password. If you log in for the first time you will have to use the predefined admin user account:

  * *username: admin*
  * *password: admin*

After you successfully logged in with the admin user account you should create a new user account and change the admin's password. Have a look at [UserGuide#User_Management User Management] to see how that is done.


= User Management =

vmaki has a build in user management which allows you to controll the access for vmaki. The user management can be accessed via the User tab. It allows you to create a new user or delete or rename an existing one. Also the password of an existing user can be reseted.

== Creating a new User ==

A new user can be added via the Add User button. In the appearing pop-up menu the username, the userrole and the password have to be specified. The role of the new user can either be *Administrator* or *User*. If you define the new us as an Administrator he can also administer the user management while the role user doesn't allow this. Despite of that there are no differences the role Administrator and User.

There has to be a VNC viewer installed on your system in order to use the VNC link. Here are some links to download a VNC viewer which can be used for vmaki. ThightVNC also provides a Java version of its viewer which doesn't have to be installed, in case you don't have permission on the system to do so.

=== Registering VNC Protocol on Windows ===

If you are using a Windows operating system you need to register the VNC protocol in order to be able to choose your VNC viewer when clicking on the vnc link in vmaki. This can be done by adding an entry to the Windows registery. To simplify this we recommend to use the customURL tool which can be downloaded here:
