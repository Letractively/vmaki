= Getting Started =

Check out the [GettingStarted Getting Started Guide] to get vmaki running in your enviroment.

= Login =

If _vmaki_ is set up as described in the [GettingStarted Getting Started Guide] you can connect to it using your browser (Firefox is highly recommended) entering the URI of the host on which _vmaki_ is installed from any workstation in your network. vmaki is running on *Port 8000*, therefore you have to make sure to specify the port in the URI. Have a look at the example below.

You will then be promted to enter the username and password. If you log in for the first time you will have to use the predefined admin user account:

  * *username: admin*
  * *password: admin*

After you successfully logged in with the admin user account you should create a new user account and change the admin's password. Have a look at [UserGuide#User_Management User Management] to see how that is done.

= Host Management =

You can add one or several Xen host to _vmaki_. The local Xen host on the system _vmaki_ has been installed can be added right away without any further modifications. In order to connect remote Xen Hosts running on an other system than _vmaki_ itself, you have to set up the Xen host as discribed in the [GettingStarted#Xen_Node Getting Started Guide].

== Adding a Xen Host ==

To add a Xen host to vmaki you simply click on the _Host Menu_ on the top toolbar and choose the item _Add Host_. A pop-up will appear and ask you for some paramenters:

==== Host Name ====

This field expects the name of the host under which it can be reached in the network. You can either enter the IP Adress or the DNS name of the host. It is not recommended to use localhost as the host name for the local Xen host because the hostname will alos be used for the VNC link which is needed to access the console of a VM and could not be used then.
 
==== Connection ==== 
This field sets the protocol which is used to establish the connection to the Xen host. In the current version of vmaki only ssh connections are supported, therefore this entry can not be changed.

==== User ====


==== Password ====
Here you have to enter the password of the user specified above.

==== LVM Pool Name ====
It is mandatory to have set up your Xen host using LVM as described in the Getting Started Guide. In this field you have to enter the LVM pool name of your Xen host. If you don't now the LVM pool name visit the [GettingStarted Getting Started Guide] to see how that is done.

There has to be a VNC viewer installed on your system in order to use the VNC link. Here are some links to download a VNC viewer which can be used for vmaki. ThightVNC also provides a Java version of its viewer which doesn't have to be installed, in case you don't have permission on the system to do so.

=== Registering VNC Protocol on Windows ===

If you are using a Windows operating system you need to register the VNC protocol in order to be able to choose your VNC viewer when clicking on the vnc link in vmaki. This can be done by adding an entry to the Windows registery. To simplify this we recommend to use the customURL tool which can be downloaded here:

= User Management =

vmaki has a build in user management which allows you to controll the access for vmaki. The user management can be accessed via the User tab. It allows you to create a new user or delete or rename an existing one. Also the password of an existing user can be reseted.

== Creating a new User ==

A new user can be added via the Add User button. In the appearing pop-up menu the username, the userrole and the password have to be specified. The role of the new user can either be *Administrator* or *User*. If you define the new us as an Administrator he can also administer the user management while the role user doesn't allow this. Despite of that there are no differences the role Administrator and User.
