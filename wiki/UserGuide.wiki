vmaki has a build in user management which allows you to controll the access for vmaki. The user management can be accessed via the User tab. It allows you to create a new user or delete or rename an existing one. Also the password of an existing user can be reseted.

== Creating a new User ==

A new user can be added via the Add User button. In the appearing pop-up menu the username, the userrole and the password have to be specified. The role of the new user can either be *Administrator* or *User*. If you define the new us as an Administrator he can also administer the user management while the role user doesn't allow this. Despite of that there are no differences the role Administrator and User.

If you are using a Windows operating system you need to register the VNC protocol in order to be able to choose your VNC viewer when clicking on the vnc link in vmaki. This can be done by adding an entry to the Windows registery. To simplify this we recommend to use the customURL tool which can be downloaded here:
